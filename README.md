# FreeCodeCamp Python Certification Projects Solutions

## Disclaimer

This repository contains solutions to the FreeCodeCamp Python certification projects. However, the solutions are intended to **guide your learning process** and **provide insights**, not to help you cheat your way to a certificate. It's essential to understand the concepts and solve the projects on your own.

## Purpose

These solutions are meant to help you if you get stuck or need inspiration. You're encouraged to explore them only after giving your best attempt at solving the challenges independently.

## Usage

1. **Honor the Learning Journey:** Use these solutions to understand concepts, not to copy them for certificates.

2. **Challenge Yourself:** Try solving the projects first. If you're stuck, review the solutions to get back on track.

3. **Be Responsible:** Embrace learning, problem-solving, and creativity.

## Note

The `test_module.py` in each project folder is provided by FreeCodeCamp to test project requirements.

**Happy coding and learning!**
